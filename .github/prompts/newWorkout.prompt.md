When prompted with 'new workout:' followed by a markdown workout plan, create a new workout file in the `workouts` directory. The file should be named using the title of the workout along with the current date and time in the format `<blockNumber>-<weekNumber>_<title>.md`. The content of the file should be in the format of a Markdown document. In addition, a link to the new workout file should be added to the `README.md` file in the `workouts` directory. This file is an example of the expected end result: [Lower Body Strength â€“ Block 1, Week 2](../../workouts/1-2_Lower_Body.md).

Ensure that the workout plan is structured with clear sections for warm-up, main workout, and optional finisher. Use bullet points for exercises, sets, reps, and any additional notes such as suggested weights or rest periods. The date of the workout should be included at the top of the document in a bold format (e.g., `**Date:** July 29, 2025`).

If the workout plan includes any specific instructions or guidelines, ensure they are clearly stated in the document. The workout should be designed to be safe and effective, taking into account any potential injuries or limitations.

Ensure that the workout plan is compatible with the equipment available, such as adjustable dumbbells, a bench, and a ruck plate. The workout should also follow the principles of block periodization, with appropriate progression in terms of weight, reps, or intensity.

Finally, after creating the new workout file, update the `README.md` file to include a link to the new workout, ensuring it follows the same format as existing entries. The link should be clear and easy to find for users looking for new workouts.
