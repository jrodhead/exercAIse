When provided with a new workout plan after being prompted with 'new workout:', create a new workout file in the `workouts` directory. The file should be named using the title of the workout along with the current date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-<title>.md`. The content of the file should be in the format of a Markdown document. In addition, a link to the new workout file should be added to the `README.md` file in the `workouts` directory. This file is an example of the expected end result: [Block 1 Week 2 - Lower Body Strength](Block1Week2_LowerBody.md)
