# Renaming Plan for 'workouts' Folder

This file documents the planned renaming of all files in the 'workouts' folder to the format:

<blockNumber>-<weekNumber>_<title>.md

Additionally, the date will be removed from the filename and inserted at the top of each document.

## Date Insertion

For files with a date in the filename, the date will be added as a line at the top of the document (e.g., `**Date:** July 29, 2025`).

For files without a date, no date will be added unless it is already present in the document.

## Next Steps
- Rename files as above
- Edit file contents to insert date at the top (if applicable)
- Remove any date from the title line
