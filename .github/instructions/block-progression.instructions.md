# Block-Based Progression Strategy

## 🎯 Purpose
Block-based progression is a structured training method where workouts are organized into **blocks (phases)**, each lasting 3–4 weeks.  
- It ensures **progressive overload** without burning out.  
- It allows **exercise variety** while building consistency.  
- It balances **muscle growth, strength, recovery, and mobility** over time.  

## 🏆 Current Training Focus (Block 5+): Hypertrophy & Aesthetics

**Primary Goal**: Muscle growth with emphasis on chest, arms (biceps/triceps), glutes, and core

**Training Philosophy**:
- Hypertrophy-focused mesocycle (8-12 weeks recommended, organized in 4-week blocks)
- Rep ranges: 8-15 reps for muscle growth
- Intensity: RPE 7-8 (leave 2-3 reps in reserve for volume tolerance)
- Volume: 2-3 sets per exercise, multiple exercises per muscle group
- Exercise variety: Rotate movements regularly to prevent adaptation
- Tempo: Control eccentric (lowering) phase for time under tension
- Supersets/circuits: Encouraged for metabolic stress and efficiency

**Session Distribution** (3x/week: Tu/Th/F):
- **Day 1**: Chest & Triceps focus + supporting muscles
- **Day 2**: Glutes & Core focus + supporting muscles  
- **Day 3**: Back & Biceps focus + shoulders/arms

**Supporting Work**: Include compound movements for full-body development:
- Rows (back, biceps, core)
- Squats/hinges (legs, glutes, core)
- Presses (chest, shoulders, triceps)
- Carries (core, grip, full-body)

## 📅 Structure

- **Block Duration:** 3–4 weeks per block  
- **Progression Within a Block:**  
  - Gradual increases in **weight, reps, or time under tension** each week  
  - Focus on improving movement quality and consistency  
- **Transition Between Blocks:**  
  - Swap in new exercise variations to prevent plateaus  
  - Keep core lifts but adjust angles, grips, or equipment where possible  
  - Conditioning and accessory work shifts slightly to keep stimulus fresh

## 📈 Tracking Progress

### Week to Week (within a hypertrophy block):
- **Primary method**: Add reps (e.g., Week 1: 10 reps → Week 2: 11 reps → Week 3: 12 reps)
- **Secondary method**: Add load once top of rep range is achieved (e.g., 3×12 → increase weight, return to 3×8-10)
- **Tertiary method**: Improve tempo control (slower eccentric for more time under tension)
- **Focus**: Mind-muscle connection, quality contractions, "the pump" sensation
- **RPE Target**: 7-8 (leave 2-3 reps in reserve for sustainable volume)

### Block to Block:
- Keep **movement patterns the same** (horizontal press, vertical pull, hip hinge, etc.)
- Introduce **exercise variations** for continued stimulus:
  - Angle changes (flat → incline → decline)
  - Grip changes (neutral → pronated → supinated)
  - Unilateral variations (two-arm → single-arm)
  - Stability challenges (floor → bench → stability variations)
- **Volume progression**: Can increase total sets across blocks if recovery permits
- **Deload every 4th week**: Reduce load 15-20%, maintain rep ranges, focus on movement quality

## 🧊 Deloads
- **Every 4th week** is a mandatory deload for hypertrophy training:  
  - Reduce loads by **15-20%** from Week 3 peak
  - Maintain rep ranges (8-15 reps)
  - Drop to **RPE 5-7** (very comfortable effort)
  - Reduce total sets by 30-40% if needed
  - Focus on movement quality, tempo control, and mind-muscle connection
  - Use deload week for active recovery alongside Wednesday yoga
  
- **Additional deload indicators:**  
  - Basketball volume is unusually high
  - Cumulative fatigue or soreness persists
  - Sleep quality has been poor
  - Motivation or performance drops significantly

## ✅ Key Principles (Hypertrophy Focus)
- **Progressive Overload**: Increase reps first, then load. Focus on quality over quantity.
- **Volume Distribution**: 2-3 sets per exercise, multiple exercises per muscle group (6-9 sets per muscle/week).
- **Exercise Variety**: Rotate movements every 4 weeks to prevent adaptation and maintain engagement.
- **Metabolic Stress**: Use supersets, circuits, and controlled tempo for "the pump" and growth stimulus.
- **Mind-Muscle Connection**: Prioritize feeling the target muscle work over moving heavy weight.
- **Recovery**: Deload every 4th week without exception. Muscle grows during rest, not just training.
- **Consistency**: 3x/week strength training (Tu/Th/F) + Monday basketball + Wednesday yoga.
- **Balance**: Prioritize chest, arms, glutes, core while maintaining full-body development.
- **Joint Health**: Continue monitoring wrist, ankle, neck; adjust exercises as needed for pain-free training.
