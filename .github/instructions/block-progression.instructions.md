# Block-Based Progression Strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Block-based progression is a structured training method where workouts are organized into **blocks (phases)**, each lasting 3â€“4 weeks.  
- It ensures **progressive overload** without burning out.  
- It allows **exercise variety** while building consistency.  
- It balances **strength, endurance, recovery, and mobility** over time.  

---

## ðŸ“… Structure

- **Block Duration:** 3â€“4 weeks per block  
- **Progression Within a Block:**  
  - Gradual increases in **weight, reps, or time under tension** each week  
  - Focus on improving movement quality and consistency  
- **Transition Between Blocks:**  
  - Swap in new exercise variations to prevent plateaus  
  - Keep core lifts but adjust angles, grips, or equipment where possible  
  - Conditioning and accessory work shifts slightly to keep stimulus fresh

## ðŸ”„ Example Progression (Strength Day)

- **Block 1 (Weeks 1â€“3):**  
  - DB Bench Press 3 Ã— 6â€“8  
  - Neutral-Grip DB Press 3 Ã— 10â€“12  
  - Chest-Supported Row 3 Ã— 8â€“10  

- **Block 2 (Weeks 4â€“6):**  
  - DB Incline Press 3 Ã— 6â€“8 (slight angle change)  
  - Arnold Press 3 Ã— 10â€“12 (rotation added)  
  - Single-Arm DB Row 3 Ã— 8â€“10 (more stability demand)  

- **Block 3 (Weeks 7â€“9):**  
  - Floor Press 3 Ã— 6â€“8 (different range of motion)  
  - Half-Kneeling Press 3 Ã— 10â€“12 (core + shoulder stability)  
  - Renegade Row 3 Ã— 8â€“10 (dynamic stability challenge)  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Tracking Progress
- **Week to Week (within a block):**  
  - Add 2.5â€“5 lb per dumbbell where possible  
  - Or increase reps within the given range  
  - Or add 1â€“2 sec hold/tempo change for core/mobility  

- **Block to Block:**  
  - Keep **movement patterns the same** (push, pull, squat, hinge, core)  
  - Introduce **small variations** to challenge new ranges/stability demands  
  - Reset reps to the lower end of range, then build again

## ðŸ§Š Deloads
- Every 4th week can serve as a **lighter week** (reduced volume/intensity) if:  
  - Recovery feels sluggish  
  - Injury flare-ups occur  
  - Basketball/conditioning volume is high  

---

## âœ… Key Principles
- **Consistency first:** Repeat core moves within a block to build strength.  
- **Progressive overload:** Small, steady increases each week.  
- **Variation between blocks:** Change angles, grips, or stability demands, not entire movement patterns.  
- **Balance:** Training integrates strength, endurance, recovery, and mobility equally.
