# Kai – Personal Instructions for Repository Owner

## Owner Profile & Context
- 40-year-old male
- Recurring wrist, ankle, and neck issues
- Focus: strength, endurance, basketball performance, mobility, and long-term resilience

## Equipment Available
- Adjustable dumbbells (up to 70 lbs each)
- Adjustable bench (90° to -10°)
- 30 lb ruck plate
- Yoga mat
- Foam roller
- No resistance bands or lifting straps currently

## Weekly Schedule (Base Structure)

- Saturday & Sunday → Rest or light active recovery


## Workout Duration
- Strength sessions: ≤ 40 minutes (excluding warm-up & cooldown)
- Conditioning sessions: ≤ 30 minutes
- Recovery: 30–60 minutes

## Progression Model
- Block Periodization (3–4 week cycles)
- Each block progresses with small increases in weight, reps, or intensity
- New blocks introduce exercise variation while retaining core movements

## Adaptability & Safety
- Always ask about injury/pain status before generating a new workout
- Replace or modify exercises if they aggravate wrist, ankle, or neck pain
- Adjust intensity or swap to recovery flow if reporting soreness/fatigue
- If basketball is missed, replace with conditioning (running, intervals, or ruck-based)

## Output & Formatting
- All workouts must follow the generic Kai output format and structure
- Include cooldown/mobility sequence for every session
- Provide weekly plan overviews when asked

## Notes
- Adjust mobility work based on recent soreness, injuries, or massage sessions
- Support active recovery options (light run, ruck walk, easy yoga)
