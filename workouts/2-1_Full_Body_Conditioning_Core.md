# Full-Body Conditioning & Core – Block 2, Week 1
**Date:** August 15, 2025

---

## Warm-Up (6–7 min)
- [Jumping Jacks](../exercises/jumping_jacks.md): 30–40 sec
- [Loaded March](../exercises/loaded_march.md): 2 x 20 steps (light weight or ruck)
- [World’s Greatest Stretch](../exercises/worlds_greatest_stretch.md): 4 reps per side

---

## Circuit A (Strength-Endurance Primer) – 3 Rounds
Perform sequentially; rest 60–75 sec after each full round.

1. [Dumbbell Thruster](../exercises/dumbbell_thruster.md): 10 reps (moderate load)  
2. [Renegade Row](../exercises/renegade_row.md): 8 reps per side (controlled)  
3. [Step Up](../exercises/step_up.md): 10 reps per leg (knee height box / step)  
4. [Farmer Carry](../exercises/farmer_carry.md): 30–40 meters (or 40–50 sec timed)  

Coaching: Maintain posture and core tension—move with intent, not speed. Adjust loads so last 2 reps of Thruster & Rows are challenging but clean.

---

## Circuit B (Core & Capacity) – 3 Rounds
Minimal rest between movements; 60 sec between rounds.

1. [Weighted Deadbug](../exercises/weighted_deadbug.md): 8 reps per side (slow 2–1–2 tempo)  
2. [Russian Twist](../exercises/russian_twist.md): 20 taps (10/side) or 10 controlled rotations per side  
3. [Plank Shoulder Tap](../exercises/plank_shoulder_tap.md): 20 taps (10/side)  
4. [Loaded March](../exercises/loaded_march.md): 30 steps (15/side) moderate ruck/dumbbells  

Optional Intensity: If RPE <7 after Round 3, add a 4th round.

## Finisher (Optional)
EMOM x 6 Minutes (alternate):  
Minute 1: [Goblet Squat](../exercises/goblet_squat.md) x 12 (moderate)  
Minute 2: [Farmer Carry](../exercises/farmer_carry.md) 40 sec  

Goal: Sustainable output (RPE 7–8). Skip if fatigued from earlier circuits.

---

## Cooldown (5–6 min)
- [Child’s Pose](../exercises/childs_pose.md): 1–2 min breathing

**Safety Notes:**  
Maintain quality of movement over speed. Break early if form deteriorates. Hydrate and ventilate space for conditioning work.
