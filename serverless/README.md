# Serverless API (WIP)

This folder is a placeholder for API endpoints. For local development, you can serve a static mock response at `/api/kai/session-plan` by configuring your dev server to rewrite that path to `serverless/api/kai/session-plan.mock.json`.

Contract: `product-design/agents/kai-api-spec.md` and `schemas/session.schema.json` / `schemas/performance.schema.json` (export).
