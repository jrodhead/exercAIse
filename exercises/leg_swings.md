# Leg Swings

**Type:** Dynamic Mobility / Run Prep  
**Primary Regions:** Hips (flexors/extensors/abductors/adductors), hamstrings  
**Equipment:** Wall/rail for balance (optional)

## Setup
1. Stand tall near a wall or rail for balance.  
2. Light core brace; keep posture upright.

## Execution
- Forward/Back: Swing one leg forward and back in a controlled arc, gradually increasing range over 10–15 swings. Keep torso upright.  
- Side-to-Side: Face the support and swing leg across body and out to the side, 10–15 swings.  
- Switch sides.

## Coaching Cues
- Stay tall; motion from hip joint, not low back.  
- Keep swings smooth and pain-free.  
- Start small range, build gradually.

## Common Mistakes
- Over-swinging and arching the back.  
- Turning toes out excessively.  
- Rushing reps.

## Regressions
- Reduce range and tempo.  
- Hold onto support with both hands for stability.

## Progressions
- Add slight knee drive emphasis on forward swings.  
- Mini-band around ankles (very light) for activation.

## Programming Notes
Use before running or lower-body sessions. Typical: 10–15 swings each direction per leg.

## Safety
Avoid ballistic motion if hips or hamstrings are irritated; keep it smooth.
