  "equipment": ["dumbbell", "bench"],
  "tags": ["biceps", "arms", "hypertrophy", "isolation"],
  "setup": [
    "Set bench to 45° incline",
    "Sit back on bench with dumbbells in each hand",
    "Let arms hang straight down, palms facing forward",
    "Shoulders back, chest up, core braced"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Curl dumbbells up, keeping elbows pinned in position",
    "Supinate wrists (turn pinkies out) as you lift",
    "Squeeze biceps at top of movement",
    "Lower dumbbells under control to full stretch",
    "Repeat for prescribed reps"
  ],
  "cues": [
    "Bench at 45°",
    "Full stretch at bottom",
    "Supinate at top (pinkies out)",
    "Elbows stay back (don't drift forward)",
    "Squeeze biceps at peak"
  ],
  "mistakes": [
    "Swinging dumbbells or using momentum",
    "Elbows drifting forward during curl",
    "Not achieving full stretch at bottom",
    "Cutting range short at top",
    "Shoulders rolling forward or rounding"
  ],
  "safety": "If elbows or shoulders feel strained, reduce weight or adjust bench angle to 30°. Great for biceps stretch and peak contraction.",
  "scaling": {
    "regressions": [
      "Lighter dumbbells",
