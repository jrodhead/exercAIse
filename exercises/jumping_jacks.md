# Jumping Jacks

**Type:** Dynamic Cardio / Full-Body Warm-Up  
**Primary Muscles:** Calves, hip abductors/adductors, deltoids (dynamic), cardiovascular system  
**Equipment:** None  
**Impact Level:** Moderate (plyometric)

## Setup
1. Stand tall, feet together, arms at sides.  
2. Engage core lightly and keep posture upright.

## Execution
1. Simultaneously jump feet outward (slightly wider than shoulder width) while swinging arms in a controlled arc overhead (palms facing slightly forward).  
2. Land softly on midfoot with knees slightly flexed—absorb impact.  
3. Immediately rebound by jumping feet back together while bringing arms to sides.  
4. Maintain rhythmic, light, springy tempo.

## Coaching Cues
- Quiet feet: think “soft land, spring out.”  
- Keep arms controlled—avoid flailing.  
- Stay tall; don’t let torso fold forward.  
- Breathe continuously—exhale every 1–2 reps.

## Common Mistakes
- Heavy, loud landings.  
- Excessive forward lean.  
- Letting knees cave inward.  
- Rushing and losing coordination.

## Regressions
- Step Jacks (alternate stepping one foot out at a time).  
- Reduced Range (arms to shoulder height only).  
- Slower tempo for deconditioned individuals.

## Progressions
- Power Jacks (deeper squat on the outward phase).  
- Weighted Vest (light) for conditioning—use sparingly.  
- Add Interval Structure (e.g., 30:15 work:rest repeated).

## Programming Notes
Great first movement in a warm-up circuit to elevate heart rate before mobility drills or strength sets. Typical dose: 20–40 sec or 30–50 reps.

## Safety
Avoid on acute knee, ankle, or impact-sensitive conditions; substitute Step Jacks. Stop if joint pain develops.
