# Pallof Press

## How to Perform
1. Stand tall holding a dumbbell or ruck at your chest, feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Press the weight straight out from your chest, resisting any rotational pull.
3. Hold briefly at full extension, then return slowly with control.
4. Brace your core and glutes throughout the movement.
5. Perform for the prescribed reps, then switch sides if using a band or cable.

## Variations
- Use a resistance band anchored to the side for more anti-rotation challenge.
- Half-kneeling or tall-kneeling Pallof Press.

## Tips
- Keep your hips and shoulders square.
- Focus on resisting rotation, not just moving the weight.
- Start with a light weight to master the movement.
