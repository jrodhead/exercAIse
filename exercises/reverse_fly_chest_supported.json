  "name": "Reverse Fly (Chest-Supported)",
  "equipment": ["dumbbell", "bench"],
  "tags": ["upper back", "rear delts", "scapular", "isolation"],
  "setup": [
    "Set adjustable bench to low incline (15–30°) or flat and lie prone with chest supported",
    "Hold light dumbbells with neutral or slight pronated grip, arms hanging below shoulders",
    "Head neutral, core lightly braced, feet planted for stability"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Inhale, set shoulder blades gently (no hard pinch)",
    "Raise arms in a wide arc out to T position squeezing mid / upper back",
    "Pause briefly when elbows are level with torso (avoid shrug)",
    "Exhale and lower under control resisting gravity",
    "Reset tension and repeat keeping tempo smooth"
  ],
  "cues": ["Lead with elbows slightly bent", "No shrugging", "Wide arc, don't swing", "Neck long", "Control the lower"],
  "mistakes": ["Shrugging into upper traps", "Using momentum / swinging", "Elbows locked out stiff", "Neck extension / craning"],
  "safety": "Keep loads light—movement is for tension not strain. Stop if sharp shoulder pain; reduce ROM or lighten weight.",
  "scaling": {
    "regressions": ["Decrease load", "Perform on higher incline for easier ROM", "Single-arm with other arm supporting bench frame"],
    "progressions": ["Add 2–3s eccentric", "Add 1s peak pause", "Slight pronation and longer lever (straighter arms)"]
  },
  "variations": ["Standing bent-over reverse fly", "Cable reverse fly", "Band pull-apart"],
