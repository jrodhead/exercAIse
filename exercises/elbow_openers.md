# Elbow Openers

**Type:** Dynamic Mobility / Warm-Up  
**Region:** Elbows, forearms, biceps/triceps tendons  
**Equipment:** None

## How To
1. Stand tall, extend arms forward at shoulder height.  
2. Flex and extend elbows through full pain-free range for 10–15 reps.  
3. Add forearm rotations (pronation/supination) for 10–15 reps.  
4. Finish with gentle triceps/biceps tensioning: reach overhead and bend/straighten elbows 8–10 reps.

## Cues
- Move slowly and smoothly; no snapping.  
- Keep shoulders relaxed down.  
- Pain-free range only.

## Programming
1–2 sets pre-upper body or arm work.

## Safety
Stop if sharp tendon pain; reduce range and tempo.
