# Strides

**Type:** Running Drills / Neuromuscular Speed  
**Primary Systems:** Turnover, mechanics, relaxation at speed  
**Equipment:** Running shoes; flat, safe surface

## How To
1. After an easy run, accelerate smoothly to ~85–90% of max relaxed speed over 3–5 seconds.  
2. Hold that relaxed fast pace for 10–15 seconds focusing on tall posture, quick cadence, and soft feet.  
3. Decelerate gradually and walk back fully to recover.  
4. Repeat for the prescribed number of reps.

## Coaching Cues
- Relax face and shoulders; quick, quiet steps.  
- Keep foot strike under center of mass.  
- Think “fast but effortless.”

## Programming Notes
Common prescription: 4–6 x 15–20 sec with full recovery walks. Place after easy runs 1–2x/week.

## Safety
Avoid if acute calf/Achilles issues. Perform on flat, grippy surfaces. Stop if pain occurs.
