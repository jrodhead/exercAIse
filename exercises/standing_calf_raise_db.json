  "equipment": ["dumbbell"],
  "tags": ["calves", "lower leg", "strength"],
  "setup": [
    "Stand tall holding dumbbells at sides (or bodyweight if new)",
    "Feet hip-width, weight balanced mid-foot",
    "Optional: elevate forefoot on small plate for greater stretch"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Inhale, descend slowly letting heels lower to comfortable stretch",
    "Drive through big toe + second toe to rise onto balls of feet",
    "Pause 0.5–1s at peak squeezing calves",
    "Exhale and lower under control (2–3s eccentric)",
    "Repeat maintaining even pressure both feet"
  ],
  "cues": ["Full stretch", "Drive tall", "No bouncing", "Even pressure", "Control eccentric"],
  "mistakes": ["Bouncing at bottom", "Ankles rolling outward/inward", "Short ROM partials", "Leaning forward excessively"],
  "safety": "Skip load increases if Achilles or plantar fascia irritated; emphasize slow eccentrics and moderate range.",
  "scaling": {"regressions": ["Bodyweight only", "Use wall/fingertip support", "Partial ROM pain-free"], "progressions": ["Add pause at bottom and top", "One-leg alternating", "Tempo 3-1-1"]},
