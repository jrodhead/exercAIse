  ],
  "setup": [
    "Sit tall with front leg bent at 90° (shin parallel to torso) and back leg bent at 90° behind you",
    "Line up both knees with hips; adjust distance to stay pain-free",
    "Square chest over front shin and brace lightly",
    "Elevate hips on folded blanket if sitting tall is difficult"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Inhale to lengthen spine, then hinge forward over the front shin until you feel moderate glute stretch",
    "Hold the forward fold 30-60s while breathing slowly",
    "Return upright, rotate torso toward back leg, and gently lean back to open hip flexors",
    "Optionally perform gentle pulses or rotations, then switch sides",
    "Repeat sequence 2-3 times per side for prescribed hold"
  ],
  "cues": [
    "Both sit bones grounded (use props if needed)",
    "Chest tall before hinging forward",
    "Breathe into tight spots, soften jaw",
    "Stop short of knee discomfort",
    "Drive back knee into floor gently to engage"
  ],
  "mistakes": [
    "Allowing spine to round aggressively",
    "Letting front knee lift off floor",
    "Rotating torso instead of hinging",
    "Forcing range and holding breath",
    "Ignoring back hip stretch"
  ],
  "safety": "Keep stretch in the hip capsule—never force the knees. Use props under hips or knees if there is joint discomfort and exit the pose if sharp pain occurs.",

    "regressions": [
      "Sit on block/bolster to reduce hip angle",
      "Keep torso upright and lean only slightly",

      "Perform figure-4 stretch lying on back"
    ],
    "progressions": [
      "Walk hands further forward for deeper glute stretch",
      "Add thoracic rotation reaches",
      "Lift back knee for active lift-offs",
      "Transition between sides without using hands"
