# Ruck Deadlift to Row

## How to Perform
1. Hold a ruck plate (or dumbbells) at your thighs, feet hip-width apart.
2. Hinge at your hips into a deadlift, keeping your back flat and core braced.
3. At the bottom, row the ruck to your ribs, elbows tight to your body.
4. Lower the ruck, then return to standing by driving your hips forward.
5. Smoothly link the deadlift and row into one fluid motion.

## Variations
- Use dumbbells or a barbell instead of a ruck plate.
- Perform as separate deadlift and row movements for beginners.

## Tips
- Avoid rounding your back.
- Brace your core throughout.
- Focus on a controlled tempo (2 sec down, 1 sec up).
