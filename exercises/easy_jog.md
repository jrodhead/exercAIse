# Easy Jog

**Type:** Low-Intensity Run / Aerobic Base  
**Primary Systems:** Aerobic endurance, cadence, form rehearsal  
**Equipment:** Running shoes; flat, safe route

## How To
1. Run at a conversational pace (RPE 4–5/10), nose-breathing possible.  
2. Keep posture tall, slight forward lean from ankles.  
3. Aim for quick, light steps; avoid overstriding.

## Coaching Cues
- Cadence ~170–180 steps/min (as comfortable).  
- Quiet feet, soft landings, level hips.  
- Relax shoulders and jaw.

## Programming Notes
Commonly 10–20 minutes in warm-ups or 20–45 minute aerobic sessions. Use on non-strength days and separate from heavy lower body work by ~24 hours when possible.

## Safety
Choose even surfaces. Stop or regress if joint pain develops.
