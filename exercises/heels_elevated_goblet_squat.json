  "tags": [
    "squat",
    "legs",
    "strength",
    "mobility"
  ],
  "setup": [
    "Place small plates or heel wedges under heels (1-2 inches elevation)",
    "Feet shoulder-width with slight toe-out (5–15°)",
    "Hold bell at chest (horns for KB or one end of DB), forearms vertical",
    "Brace lightly and keep ribs stacked over pelvis"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Inhale, sit hips back slightly and bend knees to descend",
    "Track knees over mid-foot; keep torso tall and elbows pointing down",
    "Descend to full comfortable depth—elevation allows deeper squat",
    "Pause briefly at bottom position",
    "Exhale, drive through mid-foot/heels to stand tall",
    "Finish with glutes squeezed softly, ribs down"
  ],
  "cues": [
    "Elbows down; bell tight to chest",
    "Knees track over toes",
    "Chest tall, ribs stacked",
    "Use the extra range—go deeper",
    "Drive through elevated heels"
  ],
  "mistakes": [
    "Leaning too far forward with heel elevation",
    "Overusing the ankle mobility and losing hip hinge",
    "Heels coming off the plates during movement",
    "Knees collapsing inward (valgus)",
    "Elbows flaring away from torso"
  ],
  "safety": "Heel elevation helps with ankle mobility limitations and allows deeper squat position. Ensure plates/wedges are stable and non-slip.",
  "scaling": {
    "regressions": [
      "Lower heel elevation (just 0.5-1 inch)",
      "Heels-elevated box goblet squat",

    ],
    "progressions": [
      "Tempo heels-elevated goblet (3-2-1) with pause",
      "Remove heel elevation and work toward full goblet squat",
