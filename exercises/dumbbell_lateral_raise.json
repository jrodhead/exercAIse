  "equipment": ["dumbbell"],
  "tags": ["shoulders", "isolation", "lateral-delts", "upper-body"],
  "setup": [
    "Stand with feet hip-width apart",
    "Hold dumbbells at sides, palms facing inward",
    "Slight bend in elbows, core engaged",

  "cues": [
    "Lead with elbows, not hands",
    "Keep slight elbow bend throughout",
    "Stop at shoulder height (parallel to floor)",

    "Shrugging shoulders toward ears",
    "Straightening arms completely",
    "Leaning forward or backward"

    ],
    "progressions": [
      "Increase weight gradually",
      "Pause at top for 2-3 seconds",
