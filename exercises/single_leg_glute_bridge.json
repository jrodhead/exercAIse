  "tags": ["glutes", "hips", "unilateral", "bodyweight", "stability"],
  "setup": [
    "Lie on back with knees bent, feet flat on floor",
    "Extend one leg straight out in line with other thigh",
    "Arms at sides or across chest",
    "Engage core and brace lightly"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Drive through heel of planted foot to lift hips",
    "Squeeze glute of working leg to extend hips fully",
    "Keep hips level (don't let them rotate or drop to one side)",
    "Pause 1s at top with full glute contraction",
    "Lower under control to just above floor",
    "Complete all reps on one side, then switch"

  "cues": [
    "Drive through heel",
    "Squeeze glute at top",
    "Hips stay level",
    "Full extension",
    "Control the descent"

  "mistakes": [
    "Hips rotating or tilting to one side",
    "Pushing through toes instead of heel",
    "Hyperextending lower back instead of using glutes",
    "Cutting range short (not reaching full hip extension)"
  ],
  "safety": "If lower back feels it, focus on glute engagement and avoid excessive arch. Keep hips level to prevent asymmetrical loading.",
