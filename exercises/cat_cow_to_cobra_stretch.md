# Cat-Cow to Cobra Stretch

**Type:** Dynamic Spinal Mobility / Flow  
**Primary Regions:** Thoracic & lumbar spine, anterior chain (abdominals, hip flexors)  
**Equipment:** Mat (optional)  
**Movement Pattern:** Spinal flexion ↔ extension flow with prone extension

## Setup
1. Start in quadruped (hands under shoulders, knees under hips).  
2. Fingers spread, gentle external rotation torque (elbow pits forward).  
3. Neutral neck—gaze toward floor.

## Execution
1. Inhale: Drop belly, extend spine (Cow), lift chest and tailbone; avoid dumping into lumbar.  
2. Exhale: Press floor, round spine (Cat), tuck pelvis, gently flex neck.  
3. After 2–3 Cat–Cow cycles, glide hips forward lowering thighs and pelvis to floor, transitioning into a low Cobra (elbows slightly bent, shoulders depressed).  
4. Hold 1–2 breaths, then gently push back to quadruped and repeat flow.  
5. Keep movement smooth; avoid forcing end range.

## Coaching Cues
- Segment the spine—think wave rolling from tailbone to head.  
- In Cobra: lift through sternum, not by shrugging.  
- Keep glutes relaxed in Cobra to avoid excessive lumbar compression.  
- Breathe rhythmically; let breath guide motion.

## Common Mistakes
- Forcing lumbar hyperextension.  
- Locking elbows and collapsing shoulders in Cobra.  
- Rushing through transitions.  
- Holding breath.

## Regressions
- Perform only Cat–Cow cycles if prone extension uncomfortable.  
- Sphinx Pose (forearms down) instead of Cobra for limited spinal extension.  
- Reduce reps—start with 2–3 flows.

## Progressions
- Add controlled thoracic segmentation (slow wave).  
- Light isometric scapular retraction in Cobra for mid-back activation.  
- Extend Cobra hold to 3–5 breaths (still pain-free).

## Programming Notes
Ideal early warm-up for upper body or full-body sessions where spinal mobility and anterior chain opening are desirable. 4–6 total flows typically sufficient.

## Safety
Discontinue if numbness, tingling, or sharp back pain occurs. Mild muscular stretch across abdominals/hip flexors is normal.
