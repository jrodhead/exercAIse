  "name": "Dumbbell Hip Thrust",
  "equipment": ["dumbbell", "bench"],
  "tags": ["glutes", "hips", "strength", "hypertrophy"],
  "setup": [
    "Sit on floor with upper back against a bench",
    "Bench should hit just below shoulder blades",
    "Place dumbbell across hips, hold with both hands",
    "Feet flat, hip-width apart, knees bent ~90°"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Drive through heels and squeeze glutes to lift hips",
    "Raise hips until torso is parallel to floor",
    "Pause 1-2s at top with maximal glute contraction",
    "Lower hips under control to just above floor",
    "Reset and repeat for reps"
  ],
  "cues": [
    "Squeeze glutes hard at top",
    "Pause at full extension",
    "Shoulders on bench, not sliding",
    "Drive through heels",
    "Keep ribs down, avoid arching low back"
  ],
  "mistakes": [
    "Hyperextending lower back instead of using glutes",
    "Rising onto toes instead of staying on heels",
    "Cutting range short (not reaching full hip extension)",
    "Letting dumbbell roll or slide during movement"
  ],
  "safety": "If lower back feels it, focus on glute squeeze and avoid excessive arch. Use a pad or towel under the dumbbell if hips are uncomfortable.",
