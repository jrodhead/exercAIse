  "setup": [
    "High plank with hands on dumbbells (hex DBs preferred) or on floor",
    "Feet set wider than hips for stability",
    "Wrists stacked under shoulders; squeeze glutes and brace"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Shift weight slightly to the planted hand without rotating",
    "Row the opposite dumbbell toward ribs, keeping elbow close",
    "Pause and squeeze the back; lower with control",
    "Repeat on the other side, maintaining square hips throughout"
  ],
  "cues": [
    "Zipper the ribs to hips (brace)",
    "Glutes on; feet wide",
    "Pull to pocket, not armpit",
    "Minimal sway; move slow"
  ],
  "mistakes": [
    "Hips twisting or rotating to the side",
    "Shrugging shoulder toward ear",
    "Cranking neck up or down",
    "Rowing too fast and losing control"
  ],
  "safety": "Prefer flat, non-rolling dumbbells if loading heavy. If wrists bother you, perform from fists on floor or elevate hands to a box/bench.",
