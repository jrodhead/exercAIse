	"tags": ["ankle", "rehab", "isometric", "eversion", "tendon"],
	"setup": [
		"Stand side-on to a wall with the working foot closest, shoes off if possible",
		"Place the outside (lateral) edge of the forefoot lightly against the wall",
		"Knee slightly bent, hips level, core gently braced"
	],
	"steps": [
		"Gently press the lateral forefoot into the wall as if trying to push it away",
		"Ramp tension over 2 seconds to target effort (start 30–40% max)",
		"Hold steady without letting the arch collapse or ankle invert",
		"Maintain normal breathing (avoid breath hold)",
		"Ease off slowly after the hold before the next rep"
	],
	"cues": [
		"Pressure out, not up",
		"Arch tall, heel heavy",
		"Slow ramp, smooth release",
		"Breathe behind the brace"
	],
	"mistakes": [
		"Jamming max force instantly",
		"Letting the arch collapse inward",
		"Pelvis drifting toward wall",
		"Holding breath"
	],
	"safety": "Stay sub-painful (≤2/10). Reduce intensity or shorter holds if tingling or sharp pain. Maintain tripod foot contact (heel, base big toe, base little toe).",
	"scaling": {
		"regressions": [
			"Reduce effort to 20–30% with shorter 10s holds",
			"Perform seated with knee bent 90° pushing foot into yoga block",
			"Use a lighter contact (toe only) to decrease leverage"
		],
		"progressions": [
			"Add a mini band pulling foot into inversion (resist band)",
			"Increase hold to 30–40s at moderate (50–60%) effort",
			"Cluster holds: 3 x 10s with 5s relax (one rep)"
