# Brisk Walk

**Type:** Low-Impact Cardio / Warm-Up or Cooldown  
**Primary Systems:** Aerobic base, circulation, joint lubrication  
**Equipment:** Supportive shoes

## How To
1. Walk at a purposeful pace—faster than a stroll, conversational breathing.  
2. Keep posture tall, ribs stacked over pelvis, eyes forward.  
3. Let arms swing naturally; avoid shrugging shoulders.

## Coaching Cues
- Think “quick but relaxed.”  
- Short, frequent steps over long, heavy strides.  
- Keep feet under hips; roll from midfoot to toes.

## Programming Notes
Use 5–10 minutes pre-run or post-workout to raise/normalize heart rate and temperature. Also useful for active recovery on rest days.

## Safety
Choose even surfaces. Stop if joint pain arises; reduce pace or time.
