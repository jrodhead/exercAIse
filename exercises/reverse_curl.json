  "equipment": ["dumbbell", "barbell", "ez bar"],
  "tags": ["arms", "biceps", "forearms", "strength"],
  "setup": [
    "Stand tall with feet hip-width, shoulders relaxed",
    "Hold dumbbells (or bar) with overhand (pronated) grip, hands about shoulder-width",
    "Elbows stay close to torso, wrists neutral (no excessive extension)"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Inhale; brace lightly while keeping ribs stacked",
    "Curl the weight by flexing at the elbows—avoid swinging shoulders",
    "Stop just before elbows drift forward; squeeze briefly",
    "Lower under control (2–3 sec) to full extension without locking hard"
  ],
  "cues": [
    "Knuckles to ceiling",
    "Elbows stay pinned",
    "Slow on the way down",
    "Wrists straight"
  ],
  "mistakes": [
    "Shrugging shoulders up",
    "Using hip swing/momentum",
    "Letting wrists extend back",
    "Elbows drifting forward early"
  ],
  "safety": "Use a lighter load than standard curl; overhand grip stresses forearms more. If wrist discomfort, use EZ bar or lighten weight.",
