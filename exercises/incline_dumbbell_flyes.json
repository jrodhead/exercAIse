  "setup": [
    "Set bench to 30-45 degree incline",
    "Lie back with dumbbells above chest",
    "Arms slightly bent (soft elbows)",
    "Plant feet firmly on floor"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Inhale and slowly lower weights in wide arc",
    "Keep slight bend in elbows throughout",
    "Lower until you feel stretch in upper chest",
    "Exhale and bring weights back up in same arc",
    "Squeeze upper chest muscles at top"
  ],
  "cues": [
    "Arc motion like hugging large barrel",
    "Feel stretch in upper chest",
    "Control the weight down",
    "Squeeze at the top",
    "Keep shoulders back on bench"
  ],
  "mistakes": [
    "Bench angle too steep (over 45°)",
    "Going too heavy and losing arc motion",
    "Lowering too far past shoulder level",
    "Using pressing motion instead of fly",
    "Shoulders coming forward off bench"
  ],
