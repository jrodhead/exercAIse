# Tempo Mile

## Description
A sustained one-mile effort at your comfortably hard tempo pace (about RPE 7–8/10). Pace should be challenging but steady, with even splits and controlled breathing.

## How to Perform
1. Start from an easy run and build smoothly into tempo pace over ~30 seconds.
2. Maintain a quick, efficient cadence and tall posture.
3. Breathe rhythmically (in 3–4 steps, out 3–4 steps) and avoid redlining.
4. Finish strong but controlled; you should be able to repeat another repeat with similar quality after rest.

## Prescription
- Distance: 1 mile (1609 m)
- Effort: RPE 7–8/10
- Rest between repeats: 3–4 minutes easy jog

## Cues
- Relax shoulders and jaw
- Quick feet, soft landing
- Keep effort steady; don’t sprint

## Safety Notes
- Skip or reduce intensity if any joint pain (ankle, knee, hip) or if form deteriorates.
- Prefer flat or gently rolling terrain; avoid steep hills for tempo repeats.
