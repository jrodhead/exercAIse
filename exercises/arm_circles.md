# Arm Circles

**Type:** Dynamic Mobility / Warm-Up  
**Primary Muscles:** Shoulders (deltoids, rotator cuff), upper back (scapular stabilizers)  
**Equipment:** None  
**Movement Pattern:** Shoulder articulation & dynamic prep

## Setup
1. Stand tall with feet hip–shoulder width, soft knees.  
2. Extend arms straight out to the sides at shoulder height, palms neutral or slightly down.  
3. Brace light through the core and keep cervical spine neutral (chin slightly tucked).

## Execution
1. Begin making small controlled forward circles with both arms simultaneously.  
2. Gradually increase the diameter of the circles over 15–20 seconds until reaching a comfortable large range.  
3. Reverse the direction (backward) starting small and expanding again.  
4. Maintain smooth tempo; avoid shrugging shoulders toward ears.  
5. Breathe steadily throughout—no breath holding.

## Coaching Cues
- Think “reach wide” to create space in the shoulder joint.  
- Keep ribs down—avoid flaring the chest.  
- Motion comes from the shoulder joint, not swinging the torso.  
- Smooth, controlled, and pain‑free arcs only.

## Common Mistakes
- Going too fast and losing control.  
- Elevating (shrugging) shoulders.  
- Arching lower back or leaning.  
- Pushing through pinching or sharp pain.

## Regressions / Variations
- Single Arm Circles (if coordination limited).  
- Reduced Range (post-injury) staying in mid-range arcs.  
- Bent-Elbow Circles (short lever) if fatigue or discomfort.  
- Add light band tension (advanced activation) pulling gently outward.

## Progressions
- Increase time under tension (30–45 sec each direction).  
- Perform with slow controlled tempo + brief pause at largest range.  
- Add alternating forward/backward pattern challenge.  
- Combine with Scapular Retractions (pinch shoulder blades lightly each rep).

## Programming Notes
Use early in warm-up to lubricate shoulder joint prior to pressing, rowing, or overhead work. Typically 20–30 sec each direction or 10–15 large controlled circles forward + backward.

## Safety
Stop if sharp or radiating pain occurs. Mild warmth or light fatigue is normal; joint discomfort is not.
