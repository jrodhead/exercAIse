# Bulgarian Split Squat

**Type:** Unilateral Lower Body Strength  
**Primary Muscles:** Quads, glutes, adductors; stabilizers: calves, core  
**Equipment:** Bench/step and optional dumbbells

## Setup
1. Stand about 2–3 feet in front of a bench/step.  
2. Place the top of your back foot on the bench; front foot flat and forward.  
3. Hips square, torso slightly inclined forward, core braced.

## Execution
1. Inhale and descend by bending the front knee, letting the back knee drop toward the floor.  
2. Keep front knee tracking over mid-foot (avoid cave).  
3. Lightly tap depth (or just shy) while maintaining heel contact.  
4. Exhale and drive through the front heel to stand, keeping balance and alignment.  
5. Complete all reps on one leg before switching, or alternate as programmed.

## Coaching Cues
- Think “down and forward,” not straight down.  
- Maintain a stacked front foot-to-knee-to-hip line.  
- Keep torso quiet—no twisting or bouncing.  
- Use a shorter range if front knee pain arises.

## Common Mistakes
- Overstriding so rear hip flexors pull the pelvis into tilt.  
- Letting the front knee collapse inward.  
- Bouncing off the bottom or losing heel contact.  
- Going too heavy and sacrificing balance.

## Regressions
- Bodyweight only; reduce depth or use support (counter/wall).  
- Split Squat (both feet on floor) before elevating rear foot.  
- Shorter range with isometric holds mid-depth.

## Progressions
- Add dumbbells or a front rack kettlebell.  
- Tempo: 3–1–1 with a 1–2 sec pause at bottom.  
- Front foot elevated for increased knee flexion demand.

## Programming Notes
3–4 sets of 6–10 reps/leg works well for strength-hypertrophy. Pair with a hinge or core anti-rotation for balanced training.

## Safety
Avoid sharp anterior knee pain—adjust stance length and depth. Keep movements controlled and pain-free.
