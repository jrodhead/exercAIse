  "setup": [
    "Position box or bench at desired depth (usually knee-height or slightly lower)",
    "Feet shoulder-width with slight toe-out (5–15°)",
    "Hold bell at chest (horns for KB or one end of DB), forearms vertical",
    "Brace lightly and keep ribs stacked over pelvis"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Inhale, sit hips back slightly and bend knees to descend",
    "Track knees over mid-foot; keep torso tall and elbows pointing down",
    "Lower until hips touch box/bench lightly—don't collapse onto it",
    "Pause briefly on contact, maintaining tension",
    "Exhale, drive through mid-foot/heels to stand tall",
    "Finish with glutes squeezed softly, ribs down"

    "Elbows flaring away from torso"
  ],
  "safety": "Box provides depth reference and confidence for those with knee/hip mobility issues. Don't use the box as a crutch—maintain control throughout the movement.",
