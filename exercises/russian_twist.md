# Russian Twist

**Type:** Core Rotation / Anti-Rotation (Dynamic)  
**Primary Muscles:** Obliques, transverse abdominis, rectus abdominis (stabilizing)  
**Equipment:** Bodyweight, dumbbell, plate, or med ball (optional)  
**Position:** Seated, lean-back hinge

## Setup
1. Sit on floor, knees bent, feet flat (or elevated for advanced).  
2. Lean torso back ~30–40° maintaining a long neutral spine (avoid rounding).  
3. Brace core lightly; hold weight close to sternum if loading.

## Execution
1. Rotate shoulders and ribcage (not just arms) to one side, gently reaching weight toward floor beside hip.  
2. Pause briefly maintaining spinal alignment—do not collapse.  
3. Rotate through center to opposite side under control.  
4. Each left + right = 1 rep (unless performing for taps; clarify in workout).  
5. Keep movement smooth; avoid momentum swinging.

## Coaching Cues
- Think “turn the torso” not “wave the arms.”  
- Keep chest proud—lifted sternum prevents lumbar flexion.  
- Knees stay relatively stable; avoid drifting side to side.  
- Breathe continuously—exhale each side.

## Common Mistakes
- Rounding lower back and collapsing chest.  
- Moving only arms with minimal trunk rotation.  
- Going too fast and using momentum.  
- Feet flailing excessively (regress by placing feet down).

## Regressions
- Heels Down (feet anchored).  
- Reduced Lean Angle (more upright).  
- No Load initially.  
- Slow Paused Rotations (focus on control).

## Progressions
- Feet Elevated.  
- Add Load (light–moderate).  
- Tempo (2–0–2) for time under tension.  
- ISO Hold at 45° every 4–6 reps.

## Programming Notes
Often 20–30 total taps (10–15/side) or 8–12 controlled reps (L+R) per set. Pair with anti-extension (e.g., Deadbug) or anti-lateral flexion for balanced trunk training.

## Safety
Discontinue if lumbar discomfort; prioritize spinal neutrality. Keep rotation in thoracic region.
