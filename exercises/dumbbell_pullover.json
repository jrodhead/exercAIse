  "name": "Dumbbell Pullover",
  "equipment": [
    "dumbbell",
    "bench"
  ],
  "tags": [
    "back",
    "chest",
    "lats",
    "upper body",
    "vertical pull"
  ],
  "setup": [
    "Lie perpendicular across a flat bench with upper back supported",
    "Hips below bench level, feet planted wide for stability",
    "Hold one dumbbell with both hands under the top plate (diamond grip)",
    "Start with dumbbell over chest, arms slightly bent (15-20° elbow angle)"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Inhale and lower dumbbell back overhead in an arc",
    "Maintain slight elbow bend (don't straighten arms)",
    "Lower until you feel a deep stretch in lats and chest (arms near ears)",
    "Exhale and pull dumbbell back to start position using lats",
    "Keep ribs down (avoid hyperextending lower back)",
    "Pause briefly at top, repeat"
  ],
  "cues": [
    "Slight arm bend (locked angle)",
    "Stretch lats, don't hyperextend spine",
    "Ribs down, core engaged",
    "Pull with lats, not arms",
    "Control the stretch at bottom"
  ],
  "mistakes": [
    "Straightening arms (turns into triceps extension)",
    "Hyperextending lower back (ribs flaring up)",
    "Going too heavy (loses stretch, increases injury risk)",
    "Rushing the eccentric (missing the stretch stimulus)",
    "Dropping hips too low (unstable position)"
  ],
  "safety": "Start light (20-30 lb) to learn the stretch position. Avoid if shoulder impingement present. Keep core engaged to protect lower back. If wrists are sensitive, use neutral-grip attachment or two dumbbells (one in each hand).",
  "scaling": {
    "regressions": [
      "Two-dumbbell pullover (easier grip, more stable)",
      "Reduce range of motion (stop at 45° overhead)",
      "Lying on bench lengthwise (less stretch demand)"
    ],
    "progressions": [
      "Increase range of motion (arms closer to ears)",
      "Pause at stretch (3-5s hold at bottom)",
      "Slow eccentric (4-5s lowering phase)"
    ]
  },
  "variations": [
    "Stability ball pullover (adds core demand)",
    "Bent-arm pullover (more lat emphasis)",
    "Straight-arm pullover (more chest/serratus)"
  ],
  "prescriptionHints": {
    "load": "20-40 lb for hypertrophy; lighter than you think (stretch is the stimulus)",
    "reps": "12-15 for hypertrophy, 8-10 for strength",
    "time": "3-4s eccentric, 1-2s concentric",
    "distance": "—",
    "rpe": "6-8 (focus on stretch quality, not load)",
    "notes": "Vertical pull pattern substitute when no pull-up bar available. Hits lats, serratus, chest, and core stability."
