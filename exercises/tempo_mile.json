  "cues": [
    "Start from an easy run and build smoothly into tempo pace over ~30 seconds",
    "Maintain a quick, efficient cadence and tall posture",
    "Breathe rhythmically (in 3–4 steps, out 3–4 steps) and avoid redlining",
    "Finish strong but controlled; you should be able to repeat another repeat with similar quality after rest",
    "Relax shoulders and jaw",
    "Quick feet, soft landing",
    "Keep effort steady; don’t sprint"
  ],
  "safety": "Skip or reduce intensity if any joint pain (ankle, knee, hip) or if form deteriorates. Prefer flat or gently rolling terrain; avoid steep hills for tempo repeats."
