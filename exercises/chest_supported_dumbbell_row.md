## How to Perform
1. Lie chest-down on an incline bench or propped bench, feet on the floor.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, arms extended toward the floor.
3. Pull the dumbbells toward your lower ribs, keeping elbows close to your body.
4. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
5. Lower the dumbbells with control to the starting position.

## Variations
