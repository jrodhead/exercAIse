  "equipment": [],
  "tags": ["biceps", "arms", "shoulders", "mobility", "stretch"],
  "setup": [
    "Stand next to a wall or door frame",
    "Extend one arm back and place palm flat on wall, fingers pointing behind you",
    "Arm should be at or slightly below shoulder height",
    "Stand tall with shoulders back"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Rotate torso slightly away from the wall",
    "Gently lean forward or turn body to increase stretch",
    "Feel stretch through biceps, forearm, and front of shoulder",
    "Breathe deeply and hold for prescribed time",
    "Release and switch sides"
  ],
  "cues": [
    "Palm flat on wall",
    "Fingers pointing back",
    "Rotate torso away gently",
    "Breathe deeply",
    "Don't force depth"
  ],
  "mistakes": [
    "Forcing stretch too aggressively (risk of biceps tendon strain)",
    "Shrugging shoulder or rounding forward",
    "Hyperextending elbow",
    "Holding breath or tensing up"
  ],
  "safety": "If biceps or shoulder feel sharp pain, reduce intensity or skip this stretch. Gentle and gradual progression is key.",
  "scaling": {
    "regressions": [
      "Doorway biceps stretch (hand on door frame, less rotation)",
      "Seated biceps stretch (hand behind body on floor)",
      "Foam rolling biceps (gentler option)"
    ],
    "progressions": [
      "Deeper rotation away from wall",
      "Lower hand placement (increases biceps stretch)",
      "Active biceps stretch with band (eccentric resistance)"
