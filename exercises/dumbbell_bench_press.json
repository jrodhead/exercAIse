  "tags": ["chest", "triceps", "shoulders", "push", "strength", "hypertrophy"],
  "setup": [
    "Sit on end of flat bench with dumbbells resting on thighs",
    "Lie back while guiding dumbbells to chest",
    "Feet flat on floor, shoulder blades retracted and down",
    "Start with dumbbells at chest level, palms facing forward, elbows at ~45° to torso"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Press dumbbells up and slightly together (arc motion)",
    "Extend arms fully at top, dumbbells nearly touching",
    "Lower dumbbells under control to chest level",
    "Elbows should reach ~90° or slightly below bench level",
    "Pause briefly at bottom, then press back up"
  ],
  "cues": [
    "Feet planted firmly",
    "Shoulder blades retracted",
    "Press up and together",
    "Control the descent",
    "Full range of motion"
  ],
  "mistakes": [
    "Bouncing dumbbells off chest",
    "Flaring elbows out to 90° (increases shoulder stress)",
    "Arching excessively through lower back",
    "Feet lifting off floor or unstable base",
    "Not achieving full depth at bottom"
  ],
  "safety": "If shoulders feel cranky, reduce range or load. Keep elbows at 45° to protect shoulder joints. Use spotter for heavy loads.",

    "regressions": [
      "Floor dumbbell press (reduces range of motion)",
      "Incline dumbbell bench press (easier on shoulders)",
      "Lighter dumbbells with tempo (3-1-1)",
      "Push-ups"
    ],
    "progressions": [
      "Pause dumbbell bench press (2-3s at bottom)",
      "Tempo dumbbell bench press (4-0-1)",
      "Single-arm dumbbell bench press (unilateral)",
      "Barbell bench press (allows heavier loads)"
