# Calf Stretch

**Type:** Mobility / Stretch  
**Primary Muscles:** Gastrocnemius, Soleus  
**Equipment:** Wall/step (optional)

## Setup
1. Stand facing a wall; place one foot back, heel down.  
2. Hands on wall at shoulder height.

## Execution
- Straight knee (gastrocnemius): Lean forward until a stretch is felt in upper calf. Hold 30–45 sec.  
- Bent knee (soleus): Slightly bend back knee while keeping heel down. Hold 30–45 sec.  
- Switch sides.

## Coaching Cues
- Keep heel planted; don’t bounce.  
- Hips square to wall.  
- Gentle, sustained pressure.

## Common Mistakes
- Lifting the heel.  
- Turning toes outward excessively.  
- Holding breath.

## Variations
- Stair stretch with heel hanging off edge.  
- Foam roller calf release pre-stretch.

## Programming Notes
Great post-run or post-calf work. 1–2 rounds each position per side.

## Safety
Stop if sharp Achilles pain occurs; keep it light and pain-free.
