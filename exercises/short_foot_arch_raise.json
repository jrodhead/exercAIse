	"setup": [
		"Stand barefoot, feet hip-width, weight evenly across tripod (heel, base of big toe, base of little toe)",
		"Knees soft, hips stacked over mid-foot",
		"Relax toes (no gripping)"
	],
	"steps": [
		"Without curling the toes, gently draw the ball of the big toe toward the heel (subtle arch lift)",
		"Hold the raised arch for 3–5 seconds maintaining even pressure across tripod",
		"Keep toes long and relaxed; do not let ankle roll out",
		"Release slowly back to neutral maintaining balance",
		"Repeat with smooth controlled tempo"
	],
	"cues": [
		"Lift arch, don’t claw",
		"Tripod grounded",
		"Slow squeeze, slow release",
		"Breath calm"
	],
	"mistakes": [
		"Toes gripping or curling under",
		"Ankle rolling outward (over-supination)",
		"Rocking weight to heel only",
		"Forcing a huge arch lift"
	],
	"safety": "Movement should be subtle; pain >2/10 stop. If cramping, reduce hold time or perform seated initially until endurance builds.",

		"regressions": [
			"Perform seated with foot flat reducing load",
			"Shorten hold to 1–2s",

			"Add mini band around midfoot pulling into pronation (resist collapse)",
			"Combine with slow heel raise maintaining arch"
