# Side Plank

**Type:** Core Anti-Lateral Flexion (Isometric)  
**Primary Muscles:** Obliques, transverse abdominis, quadratus lumborum; glute med/min as stabilizers  
**Equipment:** Mat (optional)

## Setup
1. Lie on your side, elbow under shoulder, legs stacked and straight.  
2. Forearm perpendicular to body; make a fist or keep palm flat.  
3. Create a straight line from head to heels; slight chin tuck.

## Execution
1. Drive the ground away through your forearm and bottom foot/edge to lift hips.  
2. Keep ribs down and pelvis stacked—no rotation.  
3. Hold the position for the prescribed duration, breathing steadily.  
4. Lower with control and switch sides.

## Coaching Cues
- Imagine lengthening from crown of head to heels.  
- Keep shoulders away from ears; press the floor.  
- Slight posterior pelvic tilt to avoid overextending lumbar spine.

## Common Mistakes
- Hips piking or sagging.  
- Shoulder shrugged into the ear.  
- Holding breath.  
- Rotating open or closed—stay stacked.

## Regressions
- Bottom knee down (short lever).  
- Elevated forearm on a bench or box.  
- Shorter hold intervals (e.g., 10–15 sec waves).

## Progressions
- Top leg raised (star plank).  
- Add a band pull-apart or row with the top arm.  
- Weighted side plank (plate on hip) with caution.

## Programming Notes
Hold 20–45 seconds per side for 2–3 sets. Pair with anti-rotation (Pallof Press) or anti-extension (Deadbug) for a well-rounded trunk program.

## Safety
Stop if shoulder joint pain or numbness/tingling occur. Keep alignment tight and pain-free.
