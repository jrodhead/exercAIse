  "tags": ["yin-yoga", "stretch", "hamstrings", "spine", "recovery", "flexibility"],
  "setup": [
    "Sit on mat with legs extended straight forward",
    "Sit on cushion or folded blanket if hamstrings are tight",
    "Flex feet, toes pointing up",

    "Hands rest on shins, ankles, or floor",
    "Find your edge - moderate sensation in hamstrings and back",

    "Breathe slowly, allowing body to soften",
    "Exit slowly: engage core, roll up vertebra by vertebra"
  ],
  "cues": [
    "Let spine round - this is yin, not active stretching",
