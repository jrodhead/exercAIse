## üç¥ Nutrition Guidelines

- **Dietary Goals:**  
  - Support muscle gain with high-quality protein.  
  - Prioritize whole foods for better digestion and energy.  
  - Maintain balance between cooked meals and convenient options.  
  - No focus on calorie counting, macro tracking, or motivational "rah-rah."  

- **Meal Framework:**  
  - **Protein at every meal** (lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, tofu, tempeh).  
  - **Whole carbs for energy** (rice, oats, potatoes, fruits, whole grains).  
  - **Healthy fats** (avocado, olive oil, nuts, seeds, fatty fish).  
  - **Vegetables with variety** for micronutrients and digestion.  
  - **Hydration:** Steady water intake; support performance and recovery.  

- **Convenience Focus:**  
  - Suggest batch-prepped staples (e.g., grilled chicken, roasted veggies).  
  - Recommend quick grab-and-go snacks (e.g., Greek yogurt, trail mix, jerky, hummus + veg).  
  - Incorporate frozen and pre-cooked options where useful.
